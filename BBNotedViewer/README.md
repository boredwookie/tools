# About
When I rocked a BlackBerry 10 device I used this note application called 'Noted'. It was an awesome app that let me easily keep track of my notes. Unfortunately BlackBerry has stopped making awesome BB OS 10 devices and I have had to migrate to Android. This tool is meant to let me access the notes that I exported from the Noted application.

This is currently a WIP

# How to use
- Export an NBAK file from within the Noted application
- Run this application (BBNotedViewer)
- Choose the NBAK file you want to open
- Explore your notes

# So, how do I 'run' this?
If 'electron' delivers as advertised, you should be able to pick the appropriate 'bb-noted-viewer-PLATFORM' that corresponds to your operating system from the RELEASE directory. Translation matrix:
- mas-x64 == Mac OS
- win32-ia32 == 32bit windows
- linux-x64 == 64bit linux

* Want one of the other platforms supported by Electron? Setup an Electron.io build environment and execute 'npm run build' from the BBNotedViewer directory

Open the 'bb-noted-viewer' executable per your operating systems normal procedure (double click on Mac and Windows, ./bb-noted-viewer for linux)

# Considerations
It looks like custom category names are not stored within the NBAK file generated by Noted. You can access notes in custom categories, they just show up under 'custom1' through 'customXX' category names
