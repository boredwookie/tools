# About
When I rocked a BlackBerry 10 device I used this note application called 'Noted'. It was an awesome app that let me easily keep track of my notes. Unfortunately BlackBerry has stopped making awesome BB OS 10 devices and I have had to migrate to Android. This tool is meant to let me access the notes that I exported from the Noted application.

This is currently a WIP

# How to use
- Export an NBAK file from within the Noted application
- Run this application (BBNotedViewer)
- Choose the NBAK file you want to open
- Explore your notes

# Considerations
It looks like custom category names are not stored within the NBAK file generated by Noted. You can access notes in custom categories, they just show up under 'custom1' through 'customXX' category names
